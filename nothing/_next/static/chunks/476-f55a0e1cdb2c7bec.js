Who cares about Taxonomic classification? Why do we have to learn Quadratic equations? Unfortunately, this is what we all think about during those six, seven, or eight hours of school when we are not thinking about food. Why? Here is the truth of the matter: the education system. The education we provide determines the communities we build. It is a fundamental component that defines who we will become. It makes us well-rounded, contributing members of the country, and leads us towards progress and eventually, enlightenment. While this may or may not be true, the NEP 2020 certainly does show commitment to rearranging its priorities and putting its student’s well-being at the front and center. The new policy replaces the previous National Policy on Education, 1986, and forms a comprehensive framework to transform both elementary and higher education in India by 2040. It emphasizes the importance of learning outcomes and maintains confidence that the new system will offer a more personalized education, full of choices, that the students will get to make.\xa0</strong></p>\n        \n        <p dir="ltr"><strong>Now, that sounds brilliant, yes?

The policy is founded on the three pillars of Research, Innovation, and Quality, with the objective of developing India into a knowledge superpower and outlines the vision of India’s new education system.
